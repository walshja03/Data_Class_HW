    "A couple of trends that I noticed from analyzing the data\n",
    "1) A schools average math and reading scores stayed consistent throughout students time in school mean 9th through 12 grade. Schools didn't tend to improve or get worse, so maybe a students abilities coming out of middle school is a strong predictor of overall high school success. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) There appears to be a sweet spot for per student spending since overall pass rate increases before decreasing.  This could indicated that spending more per student is beneficial, but money doesn't solve anything.  The highest funded are probably the lowest performing in attempts to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) School size doesn't appear to have a significant impact on student overall performance.  It would be nice to have the number of teachers so that we could do analysis on teacher/student ratio"
